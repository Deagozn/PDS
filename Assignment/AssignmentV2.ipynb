    "A close friend with above average income coming to work in Singapore for the next 8 to 10 years, and is trying to look for a place to stay. The location type of flats does not matter to him. The only thing that matters to him is that the flat is \"value for money\". \"Value for money\" refers to flats that have lots of amenities at a reasonable price. He also wants to find out whether buying or renting a flat would be better in the long run."
